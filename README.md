# CustomRNNLSTM

I am currently working on the paper
Semantic Compositional Networks for Visual Captioning
Zhe Gan, Chuang Gan, Xiaodong He, Yunchen Pu, Kenneth Tran, Jianfeng Gao, Lawrence Carin, Li Deng

I would like the LSTM to accept two inputs. The solution that I worked doen't solve the problem. Is there any workaround this problem. 
Is there any other approach to make it work?
